## Hi there, my name is Sidharth. I'm a student at VIT majoring in Computer Science.
I'm really interested in app development, design, machine learning and especially coding. I'm currently learning Java, Python, C and C++ and I'm hoping to improve my coding skills!
Currently a technical team member of the ACM chapter in my University.
I would love to meet new people and learn to compete in hackathons.

Back-end development
